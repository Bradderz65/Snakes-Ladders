## Automated Test Script (Future)

For future automation, here's a test script template:

```javascript
// test.js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

async function runTests() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  // Navigate to game
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  
  // Test 1: Create room
  await page.click('#choice-create-btn');
  await page.type('#player-name', 'Test Player');
  await page.click('#create-room-btn');
  await page.waitForSelector('#room-code-display');
  
  const roomCode = await page.$eval('#room-code-display', el => el.textContent);
  console.log('‚úì Room created:', roomCode);
  
  // Add more tests...
  
  await browser.close();
}

runTests();
```
