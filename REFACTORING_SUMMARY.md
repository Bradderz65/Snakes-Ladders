- Reduces risk of breaking unrelated features

### 2. **Readability**
- Smaller files are easier to understand
- Clear module responsibilities

### 3. **Debugging**
- Issues isolated to specific modules
- Console logs clearly identify module
- Stack traces more informative

### 4. **Collaboration**
- Multiple developers can work on different modules
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clear module boundaries

### 5. **Testing**

- Can test modules independently
- Clear input/output for functions

### 6. **Performance**
- Modules can be loaded on-demand (future)
- Easier to identify performance bottlenecks
- Performance monitoring integrated

### 7. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new modules
- Existing modules unaffected
- Clear extension points

## Load Order Importance

The modules must be loaded in the correct order due to dependencies:

```html
<!-- Core modules (no dependencies) -->
1. config.js
2. state.js
3. utils.js
4. dom.js

<!-- Systems (depend on core) -->
5. audio.js
6. performance.js
7. camera.js

<!-- Rendering (depends on core + systems) -->
8. rendering-draw.js
9. explosions.js
10. renderer.js

<!-- Game logic (depends on all above) -->
11. animations.js
12. customization.js
13. discovery.js
14. ui.js
15. socket-handlers.js

<!-- Initialization (depends on everything) -->
16. main.js
```
